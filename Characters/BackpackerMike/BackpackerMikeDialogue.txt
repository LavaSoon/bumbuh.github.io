Bio: Huge buff wolf-man with a giant backpack. Bare chest and tan cargo shorts. 
Blue and white fur and bright yellow eyes. Big smile but tiny eyes. Supposed to look goofy and unintelligent
Talks like a skateboarder/surfer archetype. Excited and wondrous, but ends each statement with a concerning but not sure if joking question. 
He is located in Nevado. 
Other Nevado NPCs (not mobs) include Kyle Zaffenhorn, Shopkeep, Slugduck King, King Sandworm, and Theodore Pringus. 
Mike is a punchable NPC. Before the shack he requires a few hits. If you beat him into submission, you get a meager prize. 
If you wait until he is by the shack, one punch will kill him and you will get a big prize. 

"Hey rock on little punching man! Brah check out my sweet pack. Traveling to Egypt or Grand Canyon; dude where AM I?"

[just coughing] "Tell you what guy. You've got what it takes man. Beat me in like, a battle or whatever and put me out of my misery??? You won't though" [laughter turns
to wet coughing and sputtering]


**Any references to Ivan are meant to make the player think he is talking about the russian animal wrestler Ivan. However, the Iwa-io graveyard has a 
tombstone reading:
RIP Ivan W.
You died like you lived
Weak -Ivan B.

Ivan B or Ivan Bruger is the Russian Animal Wrestler

**Whether you punch out Mike or not, visiting Area 52 and then returning to the shack reveals a small wolf skull, a backpack and some cargo shorts. Mike has died.
